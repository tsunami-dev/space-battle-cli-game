## Objective:

The objective of this lab is to create a simple space battle game where the player controls a spaceship and battles against alien ships to save Earth.

## Key Concepts:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Classes and objects
- Methods and attributes
- Game logic and loops

## INSTRUCTIONS

### Understand the Game Requirements:

- This is a space battle game where you, as the player, control a spaceship and fight against alien ships to save Earth.
- The game involves two classes: `Player` (for the player's spaceship) and `AlienShip` (for the alien spaceships).
- Both classes have attributes such as hit points (HP), damage/power, armor, and a method for attacking.

### Create the Player Class:

1. Start by creating a constructor for the `Player` class that takes a `name` parameter.
2. Inside the constructor, initialize `this.hp` to 1000 (hit points), `this.power` to a random number between 50 and 100 (damage), and `this.armor` to a random number between 20 and 40 (armor).

### Create the AlienShip Class:

1. Next, create a constructor for the `AlienShip` class that initializes `this.hp` to 100 (hit points), `this.power` to a random number between 30 and 60 (damage), and `this.armor` to a random number between 0 and 20 (armor).

### Implement Attack Methods for Both Classes:

- In the `Player` class, define an `attack` method that takes a `target` parameter (this parameter represents an instance of `AlienShip`).
- Inside the `attack` method, subtract the damage (`this.power`) minus the target's armor from the target's HP and log the attack result.
  (e.g. `HIT! You've struck an alien ship! Their current HP is now 25` except the number 25 will be dynamic and not hardcoded)

### Create the Game Loop and Start Game Function:

1. Define a function named `startGame` that takes the player's name as a parameter.
2. Inside `startGame`, create an array `alienShips` to store instances of `AlienShip` (you can start with, say, 6 alien ships).
3. Create an instance of `Player` using the provided name parameter.
4. Initialize a boolean variable `playersTurn` to `true` to track whose turn it is.

### Implement the Game Loop:

- Create a game loop that runs as long as the player's spaceship has HP and there are still alien ships.
  - Inside the loop:
    - Determine the current target (`currentTarget variable`) by accessing the first alien ship in the `alienShips` array.
    - If it's the player's turn:
      - Player attacks the current target (`currentTarget`) using the `attack` method.
    - If it's the alien's turn:
      - Each alien ship attacks the player's spaceship sequentially.
    - Update `playersTurn` after each turn.
    - Check if the current target (`currentTarget`) is defeated (HP <= 0) and remove it from the `alienShips` array.
    - Check if the player's spaceship HP is <= 0 to end the game loop.

### Check for Defeated Alien Ships:

- After each attack, check if the current target's HP is less than or equal to 0. If so, remove it from the `alienShips` array.

### End Game Conditions:

- After the loop ends, check if `alienShips.length === 0` to determine if the player won (all aliens defeated).
- If `alienShips.length > 0`, check if the player's HP is less than or equal to 0 to determine if the player lost.
- Log appropriate messages for winning or losing.

### Run the Game:

- Call the `startGame` function with a player name to start the game. For example, `startGame("YourName")`.

### Testing (Optional):

- Uncomment the testing code at the end of the provided script to create instances and test the `attack` method of both classes.

Following these steps will help you build a functional space battle game in JavaScript using Object-Oriented Programming principles.
